**Live demo:** [Click here to see the demo](https://romainnm.github.io/waldo-firebase) :heart:

## Project details

- Building a Waldo game that works similarly to a photo tagging app & using Firebase as a backend

### Requirements:
- Start with a large photograph which contains several elements the user is meant to find
- The user will make selections for each character and they will get feedback on whether they are correct or not
- When the user clicks the photo, it should place a targeting box around the portion of the photo where the user has clicked. That box should contain a list of possible characters
- When the user selects one of these characters, you should check with your Backend to see if that character is actually within the targeting box
- Provide the user with appropriate feedback (e.g. if wrong, an error message)
- Keep track of how long it takes between when the photo is first loaded and when the user finally identifies all characters  
- Once a round is complete, ask the user for his/her name and record that time

## Learning outcomes from this project
- Learn how to use **Firebase** as a Backend solution
- Practice of the different hooks (useEffect, useState, useContext, useRef, customHooks)
- Practice of conditional rendering 
- Use of an alert component to give feedback to the user
